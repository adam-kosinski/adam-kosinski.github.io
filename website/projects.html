                    This is a tool I created to help me learn to identify wildflower families.
                    It repeatedly shows you images of wildflowers in my home area pulled from iNaturalist
                    and you have to guess the wildflower family.

                    An interactive photo gallery layout I created from scratch to display some of my most artistic photos. This project helped me learn a lot about HTML flexbox, CSS variables, and CSS transitions. You can see the gallery at the link below or by navigating to the website's "Photography" tab.

                <div class="project_description">
                    This is a program I created when studying mathematical graphs in high school. It allows
                    you to input a graph and move around the vertices, a useful tool for identifying if two
                    graphs are the same. It also automatically generates the adjacency matrix of the graph,
                    which can be copied and used by other programs to analyze the graph. This is a much quicker
                    method of inputting graphs into a computer than creating the adjacency matrix by hand.

                    In an engineering class we created 3x3x3 puzzle cubes where you had to fit together several

                    a program that could solve the cube and output all possible solutions.
