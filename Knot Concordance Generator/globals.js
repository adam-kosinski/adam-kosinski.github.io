/*notes:

Critical path:

-Eliminate band-turn bug
-No merging into band strands
-Ensure the band goes through itself at least once (would be nice to increase the probability it will by moving further into a region before deciding next R2)

--------------------------

BUG: getting multiple types of errors when trying to compute alex poly for inputs that the undo feature was used to draw

BUG: adding a new strand that goes straight through an existing point, doesn't register as a crossing - currently throwing an error (intersection at point) to deal with this
Still getting intersections at endpoints that I don't want, despite the change to the newStrand() function in state.js
Probably has something to do about how new strands are recursively split up
	-Intersection at point happens when either a) draw a strand through a previous point, b) draw a strand, ending on a previous strand

BUG/missing feature: region won't be correctly detected if there are multiple components - big region and technically smaller regions
-> deal with this in the band generation code?
- not sure if I can just concatenate the strand arrays for all the other regions, I think it will mess up some of the region's methods - check though
- can check if "inside the region" is facing outwards, and also check if all the region's strands/points are within another region - if so, both strand sets are for the same region
- Also Mathematica fails to do the Alexander polynomial for links (2+ components)

BUG: when merging, the first addStep can intersect the merge strand (despite the check for this, b/c the band is to the left and right of the center)

FIXED BUG: Alexander polynomial sometimes has a bunch of extra 0s and then an incorrect +/- 1 at the end. The polynomial before the zeros is correct though
--> this is round-off/floating point error. Fix is to increase the math.config precision (see above)

NOTE: Currently alexander polynomial doesn't work for links

-----------------------

Band algorithm being run maybe should be added to undo stack? - not essential. Also would need to edit my ctrl+B test code BTW

Make flipping crossings un-doable?

Add a way to save results to a file, and to upload them

Add intersection at point checking for when inputting a knot? - SnapPy does the flash-screen thing

isR2Valid needs to check if points to the left AND right of the primary r2 point are inside the region, so we don't get
the band's left strand ending in the region and the band's right strand ending JUST... outside the region

Consider using R2_CLOSE_ENOUGH_RADIUS to combat intersection at point, by picking a different r2 point within the radius and trying that
-this could possibly be handled for the general case in Band.addStep()

Would like to add: better rendering for TINY strands with one over-crossing and one under-crossing
